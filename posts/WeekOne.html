Refactory is a not just a any other Tech school.
The introductions caught me worried, almost every one had a tech background, 
However everything turned out different,the facilitators rae considrate, the approach broke the ice 
and renewed my thoughts of pasive learning.

The modules about the "Seven Habbits of Highly Effective" awakened my consiousness.
It wasn't the first time to land on this book, but it is only this time that it made a meaning to me.
I appreciate all our facilitators sofar, Micheal, Julian, Samson, Kawooya, Irene and "her" Joan.
It is also exciting that I was seconded to led Group 3.
